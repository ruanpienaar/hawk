- hawk can take a list of sys.config nodes, and automatically connect to them on startup ( migrate this feature from goanna )
☐ Maybe i should honour hidden nodes, and not be able to connect to them, in the same way erlang does ?
☐ rename hawk_nodes_sup to hawk_node_sup
☐ Add option for auto reconnect / No auto reconnect.
☐ constant attempt to connect, for easier testing.
☐ Create other erlang nodes for testing ( NOT SLAVES )
- child spec as map, is not working on R17
