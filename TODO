- hawk can take a list of sys.config nodes, and automatically connect to them on startup ( migrate this feature from goanna )
☐ Maybe i should honour hidden nodes, and not be able to connect to them, in the same way erlang does ?
☐ rename hawk_nodes_sup to hawk_node_sup
☐ Add option for auto reconnect / No auto reconnect.
☐ constant attempt to connect, for easier testing.
☐ Create other erlang nodes for testing ( NOT SLAVES )
☐ child spec as map, is not working on R17
☐ Handle when distribution not started.
☐ experiment with ( -proto_dist hawk_tcp ) -no_epmd -> https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/alt_dist
